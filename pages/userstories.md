### User Story #1: Enemy Movement

As a devoloper I want to get enemy movement worked out

Elaboration: I would like to figure out how we will get enemies to move and attack, i.e. a.i., set patterns, etc...

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 1/2 Human Hours

Acceptance Test: Share ideas with team and make a cohesive desicion on how enimies will work


### User Story #2: Music

As a musically inclined individual, I would like to make the music for our game

Elaboration: I would like to come up with a loopable soundtrack for our game so it is more immersive

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 4 Human Hours

Acceptance Test: Play the music I have made for my group and see if it is good enough to be put into the game


### User Story #3: Goal

As a developer I would like to make a functional end for our game

Elaboration: I would like to make an end window that will show a player when they finish the game

Constraints: Need a functionalend to the game

Effort Estimation: 1 Human Hour

Acceptance Test: Will have a functional end game window

### User Story #1: Camera

As a developer, I want to implement our games camera system so important elements in a room or scene are highlighted/emphasized.

Elaboration: Players having a camera that highlights a critical element such as a boss when entering a boss room adds some charm.

Constraints: Dependent on the area the player travels into as the camera may center on other aspects in the context of entering a boss room compared to reaching a puzzle room. May require a function to call when entering a significant room.

Effort Estimation: 1 Human Hour

Acceptance Test: Show examples of how the camera pans to the player, other characters, or significant terrain when entering a new part of the world where this emphasis is needed/desired.

### User Story #2: Saving progress

As a developer, I want to implement our games save system so players can continue their progress through the game from where they left off.

Elaboration: Players have a part of the menu they can select to save their progress OR save their progress automatically based on checkpoints throughout the game.
Constraints: Depending on the direction our team decides towards saving progress, leaving it up to the player when to save would require us to ensure the player cannot lock themselves out from progressing through the game on accident or implementing checkpoints would require us to strategically place these points throughout the game in sensible places. 

Effort Estimation: 2 Human Hours

Acceptance Test: Have the character model start in one region of the world. If we chose to implement checkpoints, move the character past a checkpoint, reload the game, and ensure our new starting point is at the checkpoint. If we choose to leave it up to the player, move the character to a different position on the map, save the game from the menu, reload, and again ensure the player starts at the location they chose to save the game before exiting.

### User Story #3: Puzzle Design

As a developer, I want to implement some of our games puzzle rooms so players can have a variety of challenges as they progress through the game.

Elaboration: Players would be required to traverse certain areas containing puzzles which may take the form as platforming, combination puzzles, etc.

Constraints: The constraints involved when implementing these ideas into the game will strongly depend on the puzzle our team chooses to incorporate. Jumping puzzles would need pixel art for platforms or objects to grab onto, animations for these actions, and a camera able to cleanly transition between these actions. Combination puzzles would need thoughtful design where we will need to balance difficulty and the clarity of the task the player when we deliver this to the player. 

Effort Estimation: 4 Human Hours

Acceptance Test: Basic sketches of the terrain for a jumping/combination puzzle and to expect from the player to solve such a puzzle to show off to the team and seek approval. Then, implementing these ideas into the game or a test branch and checking if the puzzles can be solved using those expectations during the sketching phase.
